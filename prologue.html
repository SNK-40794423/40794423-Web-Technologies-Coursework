        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unmanly, unmanly<br>It hurts to be unmanly</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">Were you just making fun of me?<br>Even though you said you were so in love with
          me<br>What’s so great about that guy?<br>Don’t you need me anymore?</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">I want to dance hand in hand with you<br>In the middle of the crowd<br>Your smile
          is the only one shining</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">I want to be loved, but I overlooked your signal<br>Send it to me once
          again<br>Are you fickle? Well, I don’t care<br>I just want to be with you</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unmanly, unmanly<br>Let the light shine on me<br>Unmanly, unmanly<br>As I sing a
          love song<br>Unmanly, unmanly<br>I’ve finally made it this far, but in this world<br>Unmanly, unmanly<br>It
          hurts to be unmanly</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today, let’s dance and try to forget<br>About yesterday’s old worries<br>Who are
          you with? Who will it be next?<br>Sharing your hearts over drinks</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">In truth, I want to sleep holding you tight<br>Please hydrate my parched, thirsty
          heart<br>With your beauty</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">I long for love, but I always mess it up<br>Women’s hearts are like clouds<br>When
          I’m in love it’s sunny, but my narrow heart<br>Soon turns jealous again</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unmanly, unmanly<br>Watching you with him<br>Unmanly, unmanly<br>Seeing you
          smile<br>Unmanly, unmanly<br>As you touch his hand<br>My heart is already<br>Unmanly, unmanly<br>It hurts to
          be unmanly</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>Okay everybody!<sup>(2)</sup></em><br>You have to have fun in
          life,<em>&nbsp;fall in love</em><br>But&nbsp;<em>I’m proud</em>&nbsp;to just be enjoying myself all the
          time!<br>Sorry for being born,&nbsp;<em>ready tonight!</em><br>But I’m life-sized!<br><em>Guitar
            solo!</em>&nbsp;Kyan Yutaka!</p>

        <br>

        <p class="wp-block-paragraph">I love you, or rather, I just want you<br>My heart is like a dog<br>Go ahead and
          cheat on me, it’s fine<br>As long as I can be with you<br>I want to be loved, but I overlooked your
          signal<br>Send it to me once again<br>Are you fickle? Well, I don’t care<br>I just want to be with you</p>
